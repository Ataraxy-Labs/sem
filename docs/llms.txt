# sem

> Semantic version control built on Git. Entity-level diff, blame, graph, and impact analysis.

## Overview

sem extends git with entity-level operations. Instead of tracking lines, sem tracks functions, classes, methods, and types. Uses tree-sitter for parsing and AST-normalized structural hashing to detect cosmetic vs structural changes.

Git tracks lines. Developers think in functions. sem bridges the gap.

## Install

```
cd sem/crates && cargo build --release
```

Binary at `crates/target/release/sem`.

## Commands

### sem diff
Entity-level diff between commits. Shows which functions/classes were added, modified, deleted, or renamed. Distinguishes cosmetic changes (whitespace/formatting) from structural changes (logic).

```
sem diff HEAD~1
sem diff main..feature-branch
sem diff HEAD~1 --file src/auth.ts
```

### sem blame
Entity-level blame. Shows who last modified each function/class, not each line.

```
sem blame src/auth.ts
```

### sem graph
Cross-file entity dependency graph. Shows what each function calls and what calls it.

```
sem graph src/auth.ts
sem graph src/auth.ts --entity validateToken
```

### sem impact
Transitive impact analysis. If this entity changes, what else is affected? BFS through dependency graph.

```
sem impact src/auth.ts validateToken
```

## Key Features

- 13 languages: TypeScript, TSX, JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, C, C++, Ruby, C#, PHP, Fortran
- Structural hashing: AST-normalized hashes that ignore whitespace, comments, and formatting
- Cosmetic vs structural change detection in diff
- Entity-level blame (per function, not per line)
- Cross-file dependency graph via call/reference analysis
- Transitive impact analysis (BFS through dependency graph)
- Incremental graph updates (only re-parse changed files)

## Architecture

Cargo workspace: sem-core (library) + sem-cli (binary).

### sem-core
- Parser plugins for 13 languages via tree-sitter
- Entity extraction: functions, classes, methods, interfaces, types, enums, imports
- Structural hashing: normalize AST, strip whitespace/comments, SHA-256
- Dependency graph: cross-file call/reference tracking via petgraph
- Region extraction: split files into Entity and Interstitial regions
